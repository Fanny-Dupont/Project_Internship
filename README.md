# Project_Internship

Python code for first year of Masters's internship, supervised by Ulrik Skre Fjordholm (University of Oslo). The research topic is: "Traveling wave fronts in biological partial differential equation (PDE) models and their application to the COVID-19 outbreak." This involves the study of mathematical models in epidemiology, focusing on reaction-diffusion PDEs and integral equations, specifically applied to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
